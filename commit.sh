git commit -m "feat!: v2.0.0 - named exports, performance improvements, and developer tooling

BREAKING CHANGE: Removed default export. Use named imports: import { expand } from 'b_short'

Highlights:
- Performance: Memoization for directional() and isColor() functions
- Testing: 5 new performance regression tests (750 total passing)
- DX: Husky pre-commit hooks + npm scripts (outdated, update, audit)
- Docs: Comprehensive JSDoc comments for better IDE support

See CHANGELOG.md and ENHANCEMENTS.md for complete details."
